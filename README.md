Responsive Portfolio
Week 02

For this project I was tasked with making three page website for my personal portfolio using only HTML and Bootstrap CSS.

The three pages are:
1. About Me
2. Portfolio / Projects
3. Contact Me

I began by wireframing my landing page. I knew I wanted these components- Nav Bar, Image of myself, links to social media, my email address, and my phone number. I used the Bootstrap Row and Column <div> tags to organize this project. You'll see in the code that I could not decide whether to use a card or a sticky footer for my contact/socials and I ultimiately decided to go with the sticky footer. I left the commented out code for the card with social media information in case I ever want to revert to that. 

Once the landing page was completed, I used the same principles on the Portfolio and Contact Me pages. Links to About, Portfolio, and Contact open in the same tab, but links to social media pages open in a new tab. I also learned how to us Favicons outside of this project. I designed and created one with my initials and attached to all three webpages. 

As you can see, the website is completely mobile responsive and has the ability to be displayed on mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop PC layouts. 

In addition to the Bootstrap CSS, I created my own stylesheet to customize the components for my applications. 

Thanks for stopping by!
